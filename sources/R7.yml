  Each source has the info in different places, also the reliability of the info varies, this file lists where to get the info we want
  in an easy way so we can change it in the future and this also scales better for things like automated testing.

  It generally is divided into 3 categories:
    sitemap_url: it's the link to the feed that we are gonna be consuming from
    sitemap_paths: some info is already available in the sitemap itself
    webpage_paths: some info is just available in the webpage itself

  One important thing to note here is the stability hierach, the same information can be gathered from differente places, and some
  of them are more likely to change than others, the order of preference is as follows:
    sitemap -> meta tags -> og (open graph) -> html 
source_name: R7
sitemap_url: https://www.r7.com/arc/outboundfeeds/sitemap-news/?outputType=xml
sitemap_paths:
  webpage_link: //*[local-name() = 'urlset']/*[local-name() = 'url']/*[local-name() = 'loc']
  date_info: 
    date: //*[local-name() = 'urlset']/*[local-name() = 'url']/*[local-name() = 'lastmod']
    date_format: ISO
webpage_paths:
  title: //meta[@property='og:title']
  subtitle: //meta[@property='og:description']
